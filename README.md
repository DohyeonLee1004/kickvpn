KickVPN

ðŸ§  This VPN project was co-developed with ChatGPT, used as an assistant for system design, backend logic, networking, and full-stack coding.

KickVPN is a fully functional VPN MVP (Minimum Viable Product) designed for real-world usage. It includes user authentication, proxy-based traffic routing, traffic metering, a GUI client, and a reward system.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… User Authentication (JWT-based)

âœ… Traffic Proxy Server (HTTP CONNECT support)

âœ… Traffic Limiting per User

âœ… Premium/Free Server System

âœ… Reward Code System (+MB rewards)

âœ… VPN GUI Client App (Python + CustomTkinter)

âœ… Traffic Log Storage & Viewer

âœ… System Proxy Configuration for real IP tunneling

âœ… Deployable on VPS for real IP changing

ðŸ§ª How to Run (Local Test)

Install dependencies:

pip install fastapi uvicorn python-jose[cryptography] passlib[bcrypt] pydantic requests customtkinter

Run servers:

python3 traffic_log_api.py
python3 relay_proxy_server.py

Run client:

python3 vpn_gui_client.py

Set system proxy (macOS example):

sudo networksetup -setwebproxy Wi-Fi 127.0.0.1 9001
sudo networksetup -setsecurewebproxy Wi-Fi 127.0.0.1 9001

ðŸ“Œ Notes

Developed in collaboration with GPT as the technical assistant.

All networking code, GUI logic, and server systems were reviewed and improved using AI feedback.

This project is educational and a great starting point for commercial VPN systems.
